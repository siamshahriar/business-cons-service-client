        How does NodeJS handle multiple requests at the same time?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Given a NodeJS application, since Node is single threaded, say if
        processing involves a Promise.all that takes 8 seconds, does this mean
        that the client request that comes after this request would need to wait
        for eight seconds? <br /> <br />
        No. NodeJS event loop is single threaded. The entire server architecture
        for NodeJS is not single threaded. <br /> <br />
        Before getting into the Node server architecture, to take a look at
        typical multithreaded request response model, the web server would have
        multiple threads and when concurrent requests get to the webserver, the
        webserver picks threadOne from the threadPool and threadOne processes
        requestOne and responds to clientOne and when the second request comes
        in, the web server picks up the second thread from the threadPool and
        picks up requestTwo and processes it and responds to clientTwo.
        threadOne is responsible for all kinds of operations that requestOne
        demanded including doing any blocking IO operations. <br /> <br />
        The fact that the thread needs to wait for blocking IO operations is
        what makes it inefficient. With this kind of a model, the webserver is
        only able to serve as much requests as there are threads in the thread
        pool.
        <br /> <br />
        NodeJS Web Server maintains a limited Thread Pool to provide services to
        client requests. Multiple clients make multiple requests to the NodeJS
        server. NodeJS receives these requests and places them into the
        EventQueue . <br /> <br />
        NodeJS server has an internal component referred to as the EventLoop
        which is an infinite loop that receives requests and processes them.
        This EventLoop is single threaded. In other words, EventLoop is the
        listener for the EventQueue. So, we have an event queue where the
        requests are being placed and we have an event loop listening to these
        requests in the event queue. What happens next? The listener(the event
        loop) processes the request and if it is able to process the request
        without needing any blocking IO operations, then the event loop would
        itself process the request and sends the response back to the client by
        itself. <br /> <br />
        If the current request uses blocking IO operations, the event loop sees
        whether there are threads available in the thread pool, picks up one
        thread from the thread pool and assigns the particular request to the
        picked thread. That thread does the blocking IO operations and sends the
        response back to the event loop and once the response gets to the event
        loop, the event loop sends the response back to the client. <br />{" "}
        <br />
        How is NodeJS better than traditional multithreaded request response
        model? With traditional multithreaded request/response model, every
        client gets a different thread where as with NodeJS, the simpler request
        are all handled directly by the EventLoop. This is an optimization of
        thread pool resources and there is no overhead of creating the threads
        for every client request.
